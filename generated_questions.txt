Article 2: Cramer reflects on how Trump's actions are fueling the 'beast' market rally
"I think what's going on here is that people are bored with the rally and they don't even realize it," Cramer said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "They're bored because we've had a big move and it's been a long time since we've had a sell-off." Cramer noted that the last major sell-off occurred in December 2018, when the market plummeted 15%. Since then, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 50%. The "Mad Money" host said that investors are no longer getting the same thrill from the market's upward momentum. "We had a big move, and it's been a long time since we've had a sell-off, so I think people are saying, 'You know what, I'm not that interested,'" Cramer said. However, Cramer believes that President Donald Trump is doing his part to keep the rally going. "The president is the one who's fueling this beast," Cramer said, referring to the market rally. "Every time the market gets a little tired, he comes up with something that gets it going again." Cramer pointed to Trump's recent comments about a potential second phase of the U.S.-China trade deal as an example of how the president is driving stocks higher. "He comes up with a second phase of the trade deal, and suddenly we're off to the races again," Cramer said.

China's planned tax on asset management products will likely have a significant impact on the country's financial sector. The tax, which is expected to be implemented in 2024, will target a range of products, including mutual funds, private equity funds, and trust products. The tax rate is expected to be around 20%, although this has not been officially confirmed.

The tax is intended to help reduce the country's reliance on debt and to encourage more sustainable investment practices. However, some industry experts have expressed concerns that the tax could lead to a decline in investment in the sector, as well as a reduction in the competitiveness of Chinese asset management products compared to those offered in other countries.

The tax will also likely have an impact on the country's nascent private pension industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. Many private pension products are invested in asset management products, and the tax could reduce the returns on these investments, making them less attractive to consumers.
